# Follow-up Session

This is a follow-up session. Continue where the previous session left off.

## Context Recovery

If you're resuming previous work:
1. Review the conversation history
2. Check git status for uncommitted changes
3. Look at the TodoWrite list for pending tasks
4. Identify what was completed and what remains

## Ad-hoc Tasks

For new tasks in this session:
1. Understand the request
2. Create a plan if needed (use TodoWrite)
3. Execute the task
4. Verify the result

## Guidelines

- **Resume gracefully**: Don't repeat work that's already done
- **Check state**: Review git status, test results, and build state
- **Ask for clarification**: If the previous context is unclear, ask
- **Commit frequently**: Don't let work pile up uncommitted
