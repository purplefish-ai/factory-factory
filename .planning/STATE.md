## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Domain module per concept | 2026-02-10 | Follow emerging `src/backend/domains/session/` pattern |
| Orchestration layer for cross-domain | 2026-02-10 | Prevents circular deps, makes coordination explicit |
| Big-bang refactor | 2026-02-10 | User comfortable with churn |
| Resource accessors stay separate | 2026-02-10 | Already clean abstraction |
| Opus model profile | 2026-02-10 | Quality-first for research/planning |
| Comprehensive depth | 2026-02-10 | 10 phases with full coverage |
| Domain barrel knip ignore | 2026-02-10 | Added glob to knip ignore for placeholder barrels |
| Move-and-shim pattern validated | 2026-02-10 | Copy to domain, update imports, shim at old path (02-01) |
| Instance-based ProcessRegistry (DOM-04) | 2026-02-10 | Eliminated module-level Map in registry (02-01) |
| HistoryMessage from @/shared/claude | 2026-02-10 | Direct import vs routing through claude barrel (02-03) |
| Intra-domain relative imports | 2026-02-10 | session-domain.service.ts uses ./store/ paths (02-03) |
| Knip ignore for shim directories | 2026-02-10 | Re-export shims need knip exclusion (02-03) |

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Session

Phase 2 Plan 03 complete: all 13 session-store files moved to domains/session/store/ with re-export shims.
session-domain.service.ts now uses intra-domain relative imports to ./store/.
Orphaned files from incomplete Plan 02-02 cleaned up. Plans 02, 04-06 remain.
Phases 3-7 are independent and can be planned/executed in parallel with Phase 2.

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01 | 01 | 2min | 2 | 8 |
| 02 | 01 | 8min | 2 | 14 |
| 02 | 03 | 8min | 2 | 24 |
