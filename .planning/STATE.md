## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Domain module per concept | 2026-02-10 | Follow emerging `src/backend/domains/session/` pattern |
| Orchestration layer for cross-domain | 2026-02-10 | Prevents circular deps, makes coordination explicit |
| Big-bang refactor | 2026-02-10 | User comfortable with churn |
| Resource accessors stay separate | 2026-02-10 | Already clean abstraction |
| Opus model profile | 2026-02-10 | Quality-first for research/planning |
| Comprehensive depth | 2026-02-10 | 10 phases with full coverage |
| Domain barrel knip ignore | 2026-02-10 | Added glob to knip ignore for placeholder barrels |
| Move-and-shim pattern validated | 2026-02-10 | Copy to domain, update imports, shim at old path (02-01) |
| Instance-based ProcessRegistry (DOM-04) | 2026-02-10 | Eliminated module-level Map in registry (02-01) |

## Blockers

None.

## Context for Next Session

Phase 2 Plan 01 complete: types, constants, protocol layer, and registry moved to session domain with backward-compatible shims.
Move-and-shim pattern validated. Ready for Plans 02-06 (process, permissions, session, monitoring, index).
Phases 3-7 are independent and can be planned/executed in parallel with Phase 2.

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01 | 01 | 2min | 2 | 8 |
| 02 | 01 | 8min | 2 | 14 |
